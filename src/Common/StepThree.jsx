                        Did you know that 80% of your weight loss or weight management results 
                        come from the time you spend out of the gym?! Lets say you train at the gym 
                        4 times a week for 1 hour at a time, that amounts to less than 2% of your week.
                        Therefore, if you don&#39;t have a suitable plan for your time outside the gym then you 
                        are severely compromising your results.â€‹
                        I go beyond the gym walls and ensure you are living a lifestyle that will help to get 
                        you into shape and feeling great!
